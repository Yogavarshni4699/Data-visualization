# Sales Insights- Power Bi

Problem Statement:

“Atliq”  is a hardware company located all over India. Sales are declining for the past few months. The company wants insights into the issues regarding business. Tracking all the records in a dynamically growing market is hard. Reviewing large excel is tedious. It will be better if we provide dashboards for stakeholders.

I have built dashboards where you can trace revenue numbers, sales Quantity, profit margin, revenue contribution, top customers, top products, etc.,

Steps I followed for the analysis:

1. Data Extraction

2. Data modeling using start schema

3. Data merging/munging using SQL

4. Data Cleaning in power query (Power BI) and ETL

5. Building dashboards.
I have published those documents on the web as well as in mobile application.
